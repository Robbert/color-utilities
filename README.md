# Color Utilities

#### _Tools for all your color needs_

Color utilities is a collection of tools used to work with colors.

## Features

- Color blending
- Color harmony palet creation 
- Color mixers ( such as getting shades, tints and tones)
- Performing Chromatic adaptation

## [About Color Utilities](#about_color_utilities)

Color Utilities aims to be a one-stop shop for any work related to colors, mostly built with pure functions
One can use as little or as much of it as needed or wanted, avoiding unneeded project bloating.
In the future, this library will most probably grow further.

### [Limits](#limits)

<a name="limits"></a>
Due to the nature of color spaces, certain conversions are more computationally taxing than others. 
Further, certain conversions lead to data loss like RGB to Ansi16 and then back to RGB will most probably result in a
significant difference in color. 

## [Documentation](#documentation)

<a name="documentation"></a>

```sh
npm install --save @dynamize/color-utilities
```

### Dependencies

<a name="dependencies"></a>
This library has no dependencies and is completely self-contained.

### Importing

<a name="importing"></a>
Importing is done using the ES static import declaration. 
Example:

```javascript
import { Color } from '@dynamize/color-utilities';
```
In order to use theÂ import declaration in a source file, the file must be interpreted by the runtime as a
module.

### Color

<a name="color"></a>
A Color class is a representation of a color in Color Utilities. Use cse for this is when you know you will need
values for more then one color space. 

Usage examples: 
```javascript
import { Color } from '@dynamize/color-utilities';

const color = new Color("rgb", { red: 238, green: 200, blue: 27 });
```
- The first argument we pass is a string value and it represents the space in which color values will be passed.
- The second argument is the actual color values and it's passed in form of an object.
- The third argument is optional but strongly advaisable, and it's the data we want the color to have (In which color spaces),
it is in form of a string array. With out it you will get all possible conversions of the color and it might be more then,
you need.

The above example has no third argument passed and the result is the following:
